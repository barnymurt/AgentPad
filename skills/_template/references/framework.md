# Framework: [Skill Name]

<!-- This file contains the detailed methodology the skill encodes. Include scoring rubrics, decision trees, evaluation criteria, and analytical frameworks. The SKILL.md references this file for deep detail; keep the SKILL.md workflow lean and put the richness here. -->

## Scoring Rubric

<!-- If the skill involves evaluation or scoring, define the scales here -->

| Dimension | 1 (Low) | 3 (Medium) | 5 (High) |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|
| [Dimension A] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] |
| [Dimension B] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] |
| [Dimension C] | [Description] | [Description] | [Description] |

## Decision Trees

<!-- If the skill involves branching logic, document it here -->

```
IF [condition] THEN
  → [action/approach A]
ELSE IF [condition] THEN
  → [action/approach B]
ELSE
  → [default approach]
```
