# Worked Example: [Skill Name]

<!-- This file contains one complete, realistic worked example showing the skill applied to a SaaS scenario. It serves as both documentation and a "golden set" test case for quality validation. The example should demonstrate every section of the output schema populated with realistic, specific content. -->

## Scenario

<!-- Describe the input scenario. Be specific — name the product type, target market, and any constraints. -->

**Product:** [e.g., "A SaaS invoicing tool for freelancers"]
**Target Market:** [e.g., "Solo freelancers and small agencies (1-5 people) in creative industries"]
**Stage:** [e.g., "Pre-launch, validating the concept"]
**Context provided:** [e.g., "User has described the idea but has no connected data sources"]

## Input

<!-- What the user said or asked that triggered this skill -->

> [User's prompt or question, verbatim]

## Reasoning

<!-- Show the skill's thinking process — how the methodology was applied step by step. This is the "show your work" section that makes the example educational. -->

### Step 1: [Phase name from Core Workflow]

[What was done, what was found, what decisions were made]

### Step 2: [Phase name]

[What was done, how Step 1 output was used]

### Step 3: [Phase name]

[Synthesis and final analysis]

## Output

<!-- The complete output as the user would see it. Must conform exactly to output-schema.md. Every required field populated with realistic, SaaS-specific content. -->

---

<!-- Paste the full formatted output here, exactly as it would appear to the user. This is the golden reference. -->

---

## Quality Check

<!-- Verify the output against the quality criteria from SKILL.md -->

- [ ] Output follows the defined schema (all required sections populated)
- [ ] Analysis is specific to the scenario (not generic/boilerplate)
- [ ] Methodology is visibly applied (not just mentioned)
- [ ] Sources and reasoning are cited where applicable
- [ ] Confidence levels are assigned where uncertainty exists
- [ ] SaaS/digital product context is maintained throughout
